# FFT Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm along with a demo showcasing its usage.

## Overview

The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm is a widely used method for efficiently computing the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and its inverse. It drastically reduces the computation time required for calculating the DFT, especially for large datasets. This repository provides a simple implementation of the FFT algorithm in Python and a demo to visualize its application.


- **src/**: This directory contains the source code of the FFT algorithm implementation (`fft.py`) and the demo code (`demo.py`).

- **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the repository, including a brief description, usage instructions, and repository structure.

- **LICENSE**: This file contains the license under which the code is distributed. You can choose a license that suits your needs, such as the MIT License or the Apache License.

- **requirements.txt**: This file lists the Python libraries required to run the code. You can generate this file using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing the necessary libraries locally.

## Usage

To run the demo code:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Navigate to the `src/` directory.
4. Run the demo script `demo.py` using Python: `python demo.py`.
5. The demo will display a plot showing the original signal and its FFT.
