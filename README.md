- **src/**: This directory contains the source code of the FFT algorithm implementation (`fft.py`) and the demo code (`demo.py`).

- **data/** (optional): This directory can store any sample data used in the demo code, such as the sample signal generated for FFT analysis.

- **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the repository, including a brief description, usage instructions, and repository structure.

- **LICENSE**: This file contains the license under which the code is distributed. You can choose a license that suits your needs, such as the MIT License or the Apache License.

- **requirements.txt**: This file lists the Python libraries required to run the code. It should include `numpy` and `matplotlib` as dependencies for the FFT algorithm implementation and the demo code.

## Usage

To use the FFT algorithm and run the demo code:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Install the required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt` using the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Optionally, you can generate sample signal data by running the script `sample_signal.py`:

4. Navigate to the `src/` directory:

5. Run the demo script `demo.py` using Python:

6. The demo will display a plot showing the original signal and its FFT.
